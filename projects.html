                <p>I evaluated different content management systems (CMS) for my client's blog and photography website. WordPress emerged as the optimal choice due to its robust blogging capabilities, extensive plugin ecosystem for photography portfolios, and user-friendly interface. In building the WordPress site, key considerations included selecting a photography-oriented theme that offered functionalities to enhance visual presentation. To facilitate merchandise sales, a local print-on-demand shop was selected. My client’s photography was uploaded to be sold in packages of different sizes by creating an e-commerce website on SquareUp.</p>

                <p>In my capacity as a designer, I played a pivotal role in developing a sophisticated website dedicated to the book. This entailed crafting a visually captivating layout that harmonized with the book's monochromatic color schemes and characters. I ensured seamless navigation for both parents and young readers. Additionally, I orchestrated a strategic social media marketing campaign aimed at generating excitement and directing traffic to the website.</p>

                <p>My team used an Agile approach to develop an app that connects homeless youth with mental health resources and involves a structured yet flexible method to achieve our goals effectively. The Agile workflow divides the development into small sprints, usually lasting from one to four weeks. Each sprint focuses on completing specific tasks that contribute to the overall app. We started by designing how the app would look. Then we worked with the development team to build the parts that store information and connect it to a database of mental health resources. Throughout the process, we tested the app with real users, like youth with lived experience and mental health professionals to get feedback and make sure the app meets their needs.</p>
