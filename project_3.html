                <p class="bold">Background</p>
                <p>My client was a variety of local non-profits looking for creative technological solutions to assist people who are experiencing homelessness. My team chose to focus on youth between the ages of 18 - 24 with mental health struggles.</p>
                <p class="bold">Problem</p>
                <p>The goal was to create solutions for young adults experiencing homelessness with mental health issues.</p>
                <p class="bold">Process</p>
                <p>My team used an Agile approach to develop an app that connects homeless youth with mental health resources and involves a structured yet flexible method to achieve our goals effectively. The Agile workflow divides the development into small sprints, usually lasting from one to four weeks. Each sprint focuses on completing specific tasks that contribute to the overall app. We started by designing how the app would look. Then we worked with the development team to build the parts that store information and connect it to a database of mental health resources. Throughout the process, we tested the app with real users, like youth with lived experience and mental health professionals to get feedback and make sure the app meets their needs.</p>
                <p class="bold">Results</p>
                <p>The development of this app addressed challenges faced by homeless youth by using technology to offer practical support and pathways to mental health care.</p>
