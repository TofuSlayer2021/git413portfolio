                <p class="bold">Background</p>
                <p>My client is a writer and a grandmother. She had a story that she wrote about her grandchildren that she wanted to make into a children’s book.</p>
                <p class="bold">Problem</p>
                <p>The goal was to design a website and create social media marketing for my client’s children’s book.</p>
                <p class="bold">Process</p>
                <p>In my capacity as a designer, I played a pivotal role in developing a sophisticated website dedicated to the book. This entailed crafting a visually captivating layout that harmonized with the book's monochromatic color schemes and characters. I ensured seamless navigation for both parents and young readers. Additionally, I orchestrated a strategic social media marketing campaign aimed at generating excitement and directing traffic to the website.</p>
                <p class="bold">Results</p>
                <p>Social media marketing facilitated direct sales through an integrated e-commerce platform, resulting in a measurable increase in book purchases.</p>
