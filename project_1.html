                <p class="bold">Background</p>
                <p>My client is a photographer in California. She recently started writing accompaniments to her photographs of the state as an extension of her passion.</p>
                <p class="bold">Problem</p>
                <p>The goal was to create an easy-to-use blog and e-commerce website for my client’s photography business.</p>
                <p class="bold">Process</p>
                <p>I evaluated different content management systems (CMS) for my client's blog and photography website. WordPress emerged as the optimal choice due to its robust blogging capabilities, extensive plugin ecosystem for photography portfolios, and user-friendly interface. In building the WordPress site, key considerations included selecting a photography-oriented theme that offered functionalities to enhance visual presentation. To facilitate merchandise sales, a local print-on-demand shop was selected. My client’s photography was uploaded to be sold in packages of different sizes by creating an e-commerce website on SquareUp.</p>
                <p class="bold">Results</p>
                <p>The photography blog showcased images while optimizing for SEO and user navigation. The print-on-demand e-commerce site allows customers to browse and purchase high-quality prints directly from the website—a seamless user journey from discovery through to purchase.</p>
